# Twitter Bookmarks Search

A Chrome extension that enables semantic search of your Twitter bookmarks using local LangChain embeddings. Find your bookmarked tweets by searching for concepts and meaning, not just keywords.

## Features

- üîç Semantic search across your Twitter bookmarks
- üß† Uses LangChain and embeddings for concept-based matching
- üí® Fast local search - no cloud/API dependencies
- üîí Privacy-focused: all processing happens in your browser
- üéØ Find tweets based on meaning and concepts, not just exact text matches
- üì± Works directly in your Twitter interface

## How It Works

1. The extension processes your Twitter bookmarks locally
2. Creates embeddings using LangChain to understand the semantic meaning of tweets
3. When you search, it finds tweets that match the concept you're looking for
4. Results are ranked by semantic similarity to your query

## Credit to Forked Project

This project was heavily inspired by and built upon the functionality provided by the [bookmarks-wrapped](https://github.com/sahil-lalani/bookmarks-wrapped) project by [Sahil Lalani](https://github.com/sahil-lalani). Much of the core functionality, including bookmark processing and search mechanisms, was adapted from this excellent work. Special thanks to Sahil Lalani for laying the foundation.
